# CMU: 10-714: Deep Learning Systems

The subfolder contains all the homework and assignmend from [10-714](https://dlsyscourse.org/), the course builds a `pytorch` like framework from scratch 
on CPU and CUDA and implements fundational models such as CNN, RNN, LSTM on top of it.

The course offers a balance practice for engineering and mathmatical theory.

## What's extra?

- In `hw3`
  - Experimented with [triton](https://github.com/openai/triton) as a backend for `ndarray`
  - Implemented coordinated fetching for `matmul` in the CUDA layer.

- In `hw4`
  - Added alternative activation functions.
