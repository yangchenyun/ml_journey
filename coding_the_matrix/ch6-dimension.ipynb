    "## Lemma 6.1.1 (Morphing Lemma)\n",
    "Let V be a vector space. Suppose S is a set of generators for V, and B is a linearly independent set of vectors belonging to V. Then |S| ≥ |B|.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Proof\n",
    "Use algorithmic to transform S to B by exchanging vectors to _preserve its cardinality_ until it includes all elements of B.\n",
    "The exchange is taken care by Exchange Theorem.\n",
    "\n",
    "This leads to two theorems:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Theorem 6.1.2 (Basis Theorem): Let V be a vector space. All bases for V have the same size.\n",
    "#### Theorem 6.1.3: Let V be a vector space. Then a set of generators for V is a smallest set of generators for V if and only if the set is a basis for V.\n",

    "## Dimension and rank\n",
    "### Definition 6.2.1 dimension\n",
    "We define the dimension of a vector space to be _the size of a basis_ for that vector space. The dimension of a vector space V is written dim V.\n",
    "\n",
    "Relationship to geometry dimensionality. Dimensionality of an object is the minimum coordinates assigned to its point.\n",
    "The number of coordinates is the size of the basis, and the size of the basis is the rank of the set of given vectors.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Definition 6.2.5 vector rank\n",
    "We define the rank of a set S of vectors as the dimension of Span S. We write rank S for the rank of S.\n",
    "\n",
    "Proposition 6.2.8: For any set S of vectors, rank S ≤ |S|.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Definition 6.2.9 matrix rank\n",
    "For a matrix M, the row rank of M is the rank of its rows, and the column rank of M is the rank of its columns.\n",

    "If V is a subspace of W then \n",
    "Property D1: dim V ≤ dim W, and\n",

    "\n",
    "Proposition 6.2.17: Any set of D-vectors has rank at most |D|.\n",
    "\n",
    "Corollary 6.2.19: For finite D, any subspace of FD has a basis.\n",
    "\n",
    "This leads to proof of Grow Algorithm Termination Lemma\n",

    "### 6.2.8 The Rank Theorem\n",
    "For any matrix, the row rank equals the column rank.\n",
    "\n",
    "Definition 6.2.21: We define the rank of a matrix to be its column rank, which is also equal to its row rank.\n",

    "If U ⊕ V = W, we say that U and V are complementary subspaces of W.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Proposition 6.3.15: \n",
    "For any vector space W and any subspace U of W, there is a subspace V of W such that W = U ⊕ V.\n",
